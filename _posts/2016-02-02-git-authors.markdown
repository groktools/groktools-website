**git-authors** is a simple addition to your editor - it displays the authors for a file so that you can contact them if required. Their % contributions are also shown.

# Why git-authors
As found by [Maalej et al](https://mobis.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TOSEM-Maalej-Comprehension-PrePrint2.pdf) (page 20):

> The more people developers know, the easier they can identify which ex- perience is worth sharing, with whom, and how.

A simple Atom plugin bridges this gap by displaying the list of authors along with their percentage contribution to the file by line.

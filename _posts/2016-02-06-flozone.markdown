An Atom toolbar to help you achieve flow state (aka "the Zone") and stay there through interruptions.

# Why flozone
As found by [Parnin](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/):

>Episodic memory is the recollection of past events.

>Software developers continually encounter new learning experiences about their craft. Retaining and making use of those such acquired knowledge requires that developers are able to recollect those experiences from their episodic memory. When recalling from episodic memory, developers commonly experience failures that limit their ability to recall essential details or recollect the key events. For example, a developer may forget the changes they performed for a programming task, or forget details such as a the blog post that was used for implementing a part of the task.

`flozone` takes this idea to the simplest manifestation - a toolbar that uses the familiar media player metaphor to help you remember what you're doing and help you tide through interruptions

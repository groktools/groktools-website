A userspace tracker for everything you do on your computer while you code.

# Why lilbro
As found by [Maalej et al](https://mobis.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/TOSEM-Maalej-Comprehension-PrePrint2.pdf) (page 25):

>...we asked developers whether they would share knowledge if their development environments would automatically capture it. ... Overall, respondents are rather willing to share knowledge automatically. More than 85% of respondents would share the context of an encountered problem and actions performed to solve it. About 75% agreed to share other knowledge such as the goal of changing a particular piece of code or sources consulted while solving a particular problem. This kind of knowledge would facilitate program comprehension tasks.

`lilbro` takes this idea to the simplest and extreme manifestation - a tracker for everything that you could do on a computer so that you can review it later, reflect on it and potentially share it.
